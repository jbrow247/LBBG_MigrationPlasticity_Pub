# LBBG_MigrationPlasticity_Pub
 Cleaned code for publication

This repository contains the publication versions of two scripts that generate the results for the manuscript “Does migration distance influence intra-individual variation of migratory behaviour in a seabird species with diverse migration strategies?”.  V1 are the scripts for the original manuscript (December 2019). V2 are the scripts used for the revised manuscript (July 2020). 

1) LBBG_plasticity_pub.R is the workhorse containing most data processing, and creation of files for analysis. 
It generates the data files required for (2). 
It also generates Figures S1 and S3 in the supplementary materail 

2) LBBG_plasticity_results_pub.Rmd carries out the statistical analysis on the data processed in (1). 
The Rmd outputs the text of the results section, as well as the figures and data contained in the tables.
